This project is a simple presence-sensing light switch that
uses a Passive Infra-Red (PIR) sensor module and/or a pushbutton
to provide a dimmable LED light controller.

It is intended for low-power household lighting that is activated 
when a person enters a room (eg bathrooms).

A detailed description of the project goals and design is in pir-lite.md.
